!!! READ THIS BEFORE MAKING AN NFT !!!

1. Your NFT name should be in PascalCase, e.g. if your token is named 'Heavy Crown',
     then the image should be named 'HeavyCrown.png', so that the NFT file generated by the miner is 'HeavyCrown.imnft'.

2. If you want to add some properties to your NFT or create a new version of it, then add '_' after the name and then
     write the property (or version).
   Examples:
     'Heavy Crown (Red)' -> HeavyCrown_Red.png
     'Heavy Crown (v2)' -> HeavyCrown_v2.png
     'Heavy Crown 2' -> HeavyCrown_2.png

3. If you want to bind author name to your NFT (forever), do that by appending '_BY_' and then
     author name in Pascal_Case_With_Underscores, except for nicknames.
   Examples:
     'Rosenrot by ImageTaker Foundation' -> Rosenrot_BY_ImageTaker_Foundation.png
     'Golden Queen Society Logo by maxt86' -> GoldenQueenSocietyLogo_BY_maxt86.png

4. ImageMaker NFTs can only be named using a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.
